## Hello! 👋

Welcome to the GitHub organization page for CIBIT, the Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research.

🙋‍♀️ CIBIT is a research lab hosted at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and a leading institution in multimodal biomedical imaging.
Its current focus is on biomedical imaging and translational research, with a strong record in Cognitive, Translational and Clinical Neuroscience.

👩‍💻 This is the lab's workspace for several repositories related to ongoing projects (many are still private, but we promise to be working on that).

🍿 Fun fact - most of our lab members work at an awkwardly shaped building. If you don't believe it, just search for ICNAS.
